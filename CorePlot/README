CorePlot
========

Binding to the CorePlot open source library for MonoTouch and MonoMac,
available from:

	  http://code.google.com/p/core-plot/

This binding is for version 0.2.2 released on November 10, 2010

	iOS Warning: this wont build with the released MonoTouch (as
	of March 8th 2011), as I took a dependency on MonoTouch
	4.0 and we are still fixing a few bugs there.

You can use the binaries provided in the meantime.

To build from source:

	For iOS:
	   make ios
	
	For OSX:
	   make osx
